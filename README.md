# Indiana Election Shapefiles
This data was processed by members of the MGGG Redistricting Lab and student research assistant, Rachel Herman.

## Sources
The 2016 precinct boundary shapefile was obtained by contacting the Indiana Secretary of State Election Division. The 2016 election data was downloaded from MIT Election and Data Science Lab, except for attorney general results for Hancock County, Jefferson County, and Madison County. Hancock County election results are from a contact in the County Clerk's Election Department, Jefferson County results are from a contact in the County Clerk's Office of Voter Registration, and Madison County Results are from the county's [Election Board](https://www.madisoncounty.in.gov/assets/precinct-report-------madison-county2016.pdf).

The 2010 Decennial Census block shapefile and demographic data were downloaded from the [National Historic GIS](https://data2.nhgis.org/main#).


## Processing
This shapefile required minimal processing. No digitizing, merging, or splitting of precincts was required. Demographic data were aggregated from the block level using MGGGâ€™s geospatial toolkit.
